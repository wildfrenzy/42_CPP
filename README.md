## About The Project
> The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
> This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
> to learn OOP. Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
> comply with the C++98 standard.
